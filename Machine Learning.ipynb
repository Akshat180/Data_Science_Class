    "- **Machine Learning (ML)** is basically that field of computer science with the help of which computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings do.\n",
    "- In simple words, `ML` is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method.\n",
    "- The key focus of `ML` is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention."
